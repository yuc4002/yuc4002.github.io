I obtained a BA in Mathematics and Bs in Economics from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 2017. Then I worked one year as the Only Math Intern in Math department at Hobart and William Smith Colleges. I recently joined the Weill Cornell Medicine with a MS in biostatistics and Data Science in 2019.
